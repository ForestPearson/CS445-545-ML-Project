## CS445-545-ML-Project

This is the term project for our CS-454/545 spring term course at PSU. For this project we compared the results of processing the Cifar-10 dataset on several differing networks. With those being a CNN, MLP, and Kmeans algorithm.

## Build instructions

To obtain the dataset itself visit here:

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

To run the CNN it is required to install the Nvidia CUDA and CUDNN software found here: 

https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html

To run the remainding software it is required to install the following libraries:

- Numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- sklearn.metrics
- sklearn.cluster
